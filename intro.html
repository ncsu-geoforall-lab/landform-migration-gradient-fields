    <h3>Landscape Dynamics</h3>
<ul>
<li>Water, wind, gravitation, plants, animals and humans continuously change landscape surface
<li>Land surface processes are poorly understood and our predictive capabilities are limited 
<li>Hazard management decisions are often based on insufficient information
</ul>

    <h3>Advances in 3D mapping</h3>
<ul>
<li>Lidar and sUAS: increased capacity to 
map 3D landscapes and assess the change on (almost) continuous basis
<li>Development of tools for terrain time series analysis
<li>Data for predictive models development, calibration and validation
to improve hazards management
</ul>

    <h3>Multivariate terrain time series analysis</h3>
<ul>
<li>1D lines - transects, horizontal migration of line features: shorelines, dune crests, channels
<li>2D rasters - per cell statistics, core and envelope, rate of vertical change
<li>3D rasters - space-time cube contour evolution isosurfaces
</ul>

    <h3>Analysis of migrating landforms</h3> 
<p class="small">Horizontal migration is often associated with change in landform geometry
which is hard to measure with standard transects </p>

    <h3>Gradient field of horizontal migration</h3>
<ul>
<li>Measure the rate and direction of landform migration at any point in space and time
<li>Study spatial pattern of migration vectors 
</ul>

<p class="small">
We use the concept of Space-Time Cube where for any contour <i>z=const</i> we can define a function
<i>t=g(x,y)</i>
where <i>t</i> is the time when this contour is located at the point <i>(x,y)</i>.
For <i>g(x,y)</i> to be a function, we need to segment time series of contours into 
non-intersecting segments.
Then rate of migration is inverse of the gradient magnitude of the function <i>g(x,y)</i>.
