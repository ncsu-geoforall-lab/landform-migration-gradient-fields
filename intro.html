    <h2>Landscape Dynamics</h2>
Water, wind, gravitation, plants, animals and humans continuously change landscape surface
Land surface processes are poorly understood and our predictive capabilities are limited 
Hazard Management decisions are often based on insufficient information

    <h2>Advances in 3D mapping</h2>
Lidar and sUAS structure from motion dramatically increased our capacity to 
map 3D landscapes and assess the change on (almost) continuous basis
Rapid development of tools for terrain time series analysis

    <h2>Multivariate terrain time series analysis</h2>
1D lines - transects, horizontal migration of line features: shorelines, contours, ridges, crests, channels
2D rasters - per cell statistics, core and envelope, rate of vertical change
3D rasters - space-time cube contour evolution isosurfaces

    <h2>Horizontal migration Analytics</h2>
Visualization shows that the dune moves mostly south, raster based analysis quantifies vertical change
Horizontal migration was measured by extracting crests and manually measuring distances along transects
Result are rates but we also need to know:
do the rates of migration change with elevation?
does the direction of migration change over time

    <h3>Shoreline transects</h3>
    <img src="img/transects.svg" width="100%">
    <aside class="notes">
        We study evolving shorelines using transects.
        Transects divide shoreline and specify areas where we measure the changes.
        There are very good algorithms for creating transects, for example in GRASS GIS.
        However, transects for one set of shorelines might not work when
        shoreline changes significantly.

    <h3>Connecting contours</h3>
    <img src="img/connections.svg" width="100%">
    <aside class="notes">
        Shorelines and contours are similar.
        To relate two different shorelines or contours we can draw
        the connections manually.
        This is a lot of work and it's impossible to reproduce.

    <h4>Isosurface of a countour (Jockeyâ€™s Ridge dune)</h4>

        Advanced method of exploratory visualization are isosurfaces of space time cube.
        I will not go into details.
        I will just say that isosurface represents one contour throughout the years.
        Although our group is using the technique a lot
        and the appropriate tools are available in GRASS GIS,
        the visualization is hard to understand and the tools for it
        are generally not available.
