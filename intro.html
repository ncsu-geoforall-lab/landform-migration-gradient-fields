    <h3>Landscape Dynamics</h3>
<br>Water, wind, gravitation, plants, animals and humans continuously change landscape surface
<br>Land surface processes are poorly understood and our predictive capabilities are limited 
<br>Hazard Management decisions are often based on insufficient information

    <h3>Advances in 3D mapping</h3>
<br>Lidar and sUAS structure from motion dramatically increased our capacity to 
map 3D landscapes and assess the change on (almost) continuous basis
<br>Rapid development of tools for terrain time series analysis
</section>

<section>
    <h3>Multivariate terrain time series analysis</h3>
<br>1D lines - transects, horizontal migration of line features: shorelines, contours, ridges, crests, channels
<br>2D rasters - per cell statistics, core and envelope, rate of vertical change
<br>3D rasters - space-time cube contour evolution isosurfaces

    <h3>Horizontal migration Analysis</h3>
Horizontal migration was measured by extracting crests and manually measuring distances along transects

    <h3>Horizontal Migration Analysis in STC</h3>
do the rates of migration change with elevation?  does the direction of migration change over time
migration rate at given elevation - migration of contour
segment time series of zi=c, i=1,...n into non-intersecting segments, then

        Advanced method of exploratory visualization are isosurfaces of space time cube.
        I will not go into details.
        I will just say that isosurface represents one contour throughout the years.
        Although our group is using the technique a lot
        and the appropriate tools are available in GRASS GIS,
        the visualization is hard to understand and the tools for it
        are generally not available.
