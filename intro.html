        Current techniques used to study landform migration have limitations.
        Jockey’s Ridge dune (Nags Head, The Outer Banks, NC) is moving and changing.
        Animation in 2D and 3D.
        Not quantitative.

    <h3>Shoreline transects</h3>
    <img src="img/transects.svg" width="100%">
    <aside class="notes">
        We study evolving shorelines using transects.
        Transects divide shoreline and specify areas where we measure the changes.
        There are very good algorithms for creating transects, for example in GRASS GIS.
        However, transects for one set of shorelines might not work when
        shoreline changes significantly.

    <h3>Connecting contours</h3>
    <img src="img/connections.svg" width="100%">
    <aside class="notes">
        Shorelines and contours are similar.
        To relate two different shorelines or contours we can draw
        the connections manually.
        This is a lot of work and it's impossible to reproduce.

        Advanced method of exploratory visualization are isosurfaces of space time cube.
        I will not go into details.
        I will just say that isosurface represents one contour throughout the years.
        Although our group is using the technique a lot
        and the appropriate tools are available in GRASS GIS,
        the visualization is hard to understand and the tools for it
        are generally not available.
