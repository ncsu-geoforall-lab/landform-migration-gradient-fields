    <h3>Landscape Dynamics</h3>
<ul>
<li>Water, wind, gravitation, plants, animals and humans continuously change landscape surface
<li>Land surface processes are poorly understood and our predictive capabilities are limited 
<li>Hazard management decisions are often based on insufficient information
</ul>

    <h3>Advances in 3D mapping</h3>
<ul>
<li>Lidar and sUAS structure from motion: increased capacity to 
map 3D landscapes and assess the change on (almost) continuous basis
<li>Development of tools for terrain time series analysis
<li>Data for predictive models development, calibration and validation
</ul>

    <h3>Multivariate terrain time series analysis</h3>
<ul>
<li>1D lines - transects, horizontal migration of line features: shorelines, dune crests, channels
<li>2D rasters - per cell statistics, core and envelope, rate of vertical change
<li>3D rasters - space-time cube contour evolution isosurfaces
</ul>

    <h3>Analysis of migrating landforms</h3> 
<p>Horizontal migration is often associated with change in landform geometry
which is hard to measure with standard transects 
<p class="small">case study: Jockey's Ridge dune
horizontal migration was measured by extracting crests and manually measuring distances along transects
resulting in spatially agreggated rates

    <h3>Gradient field of horizontal migration</h3>
Quantitative spatially distributed measure of landform migration: magnitude and direction
<p class="small">
do the rates of migration change with elevation?  does the direction of migration change over time
migration rate at given elevation - migration of contour
segment time series of zi=c, i=1,...n into non-intersecting segments, then
t = gc(x,y)
